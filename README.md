# Challenge-03

## Brain storm
At first I google to figure out how to do generating random charater password ([source](https://dev.to/code_mystery/random-password-generator-using-javascript-6a)) to have the general idea about making password, so it is not my own work.

The (template) script for my challenge will be some what related to 

![this](./Develop/assets/images/img%201.PNG)

Then compare to the challenge, I have to figure out how to :

*How to add condition that is greater than 8 character is accept.

*How to prompt uppercase, lowercase, numeric, special character.

## Generating password with condition of 8 and above charater:

Remind of last module, I apply `if` method to make sure I am asked how many charaters for my pasword, and I am only accepted when I enter more than 8, then the (template) script become to

And the result:

which I want to.

Bonus: I was testing to see if `var chars` will become `var pass` so that I can do my next issue, and it quite work.

Back to challenge, there are some changing that allow me go through the challenge I have my first develop output
